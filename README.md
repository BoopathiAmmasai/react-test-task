### Task

Please create simple contacts management app.

* On the main screen, the list of contacts should be displayed.
* The search field at the top of the main screen should provide ability to search among all contacts by any field:
 For example: If I enter 'John', it should display those contacts whose name, email or phone (unlikely phone will contain letters) include 'john' (case-insensitive),
 if I enter '12' it should display those contacts whose name, email or phone include '12', etc.
* When "Add Contact" button on main screen is clicked, new contact card should appear with following fields:
    * Name
    * Phone
    * Email
    * Edit Button.
    * Favourite Button.
* Edit contact button should navigate to new screen that will allow editing of a contact and saving it.
* Favourite button should add contact to list of favourites.
* Create "Favourites" view that only displays favourited contacts.
* All data should be stored locally (local storage)

#### Additionally
* Please use React and Redux for this app.
* You can add any modules that you required for the tasks or if you wanna add something.
* For UI you can use any library of your choice (for example, bootstrap)
* "Favourite" feature is optional, implement it if you have enough time.

Good Luck!
